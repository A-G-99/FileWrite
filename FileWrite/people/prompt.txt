Create a console application that prompts some details from the user and save them to a file.
Design your solution while keeping in mind that in the future we might need to switch from this platform to a web service architecture or support other platforms, sharing code between them.

Details:
	- Person Details
		- FirstName
		- Surname
		- Date of birth
		- Marital status
	- If married, save husband / wife details (same as above) to a separate linked file (see sample below)

Business Rules:
	- If age less than 18 ask for parent's authorisation (just a boolean indicating yes/no "My parents allow registration")
		- If not authorized, deny registration
	- If age less than 16 deny registration
	- Save all records into a file called "People.txt"
	- Spouse information can be saved wherever you want, but keep in mind that different people might have the same wife/husband names

Your solution will be evaluated based on the follow parameters:
	•	Maintability
	•	Reusability
	•	Readability
	•	Configurability
	•	Testability
	•	Performance
	•	Versatility
	•	Tests quality & coverage

===============================================

Example People File at c:\people\mainfile.txt:
John|Doe|01-12-1980|Single|null|c:\people\spouses\Anna.txt
Paul|Murphy|01-12-2001|Single|yes|

Design Choices:
•	Information Abstract Class for all the current info. I am assuming this is all the base case info.
	If anything needs to be added it can be added to the Person class/Information Abstact. This will improve maintainability as the info we collect now can
	be expanded to without messing with the info we have to base collect.
•	Making everything into caps to improve readability, maintainability
•	Using relative paths

More Ideas:
•	Make all dialogue a resource file that can be then edited by anyone with no code.
